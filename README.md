Snowplow is a scalable open-source platform for rich, high quality, low-latency data collection. It is designed to collect high quality, complete behavioral data for enterprise business.

**To find out more, please check out the [Snowplow website][website] and our [documentation][docs].**

## Snowplow React-Native Tracker Overview

The Snowplow React Native Tracker allows you to add analytics to your React Native apps when using a [Snowplow][snowplow] pipeline.

With this library you can collect granular event-level data as your users interact with your React Native applications. It is build on top of Snowplow's [Mobile Native][native-trackers] [iOS][objc-tracker] and [Android][android-tracker] Trackers, in order to support the full range of out-of-the-box Snowplow events and tracking capabilities.

## Quick start

From the root of your [React Native][react-native] project:

```sh
npm install --save @snowplow/react-native-tracker
npx pod-install
```

In your `ios/Podfile` file (unless using Expo Go), please add the `FMDB` dependency with `modular_headers` set to `true`. This is necessary to make the `FMDB` package generate module maps so that it can be used by the tracker:

```rb
pod 'FMDB', :modular_headers => true
```

Then, instrument the tracker in your app and start tracking events. For example:

```javascript
import { createTracker } from '@snowplow/react-native-tracker';

const tracker = createTracker(
    'my-namespace',
    { endpoint: 'https://my-collector.endpoint' }
);

tracker.trackScreenViewEvent({ name: 'myScreenName' });
```

The Snowplow React Native Tracker also provides first-class support for TypeScript, as it is fully typed.

See also our [DemoApp][demoapp] for an example implementation.

## Maintainer quick start

Assuming a [react-native environment][react-native-environment] is set up, from the root of the repository:

```bash
yarn
```

### Unit tests

To run the unit tests, simply execute:

```sh
yarn test
```

### Launching the example app

Replace "placeholder" with the URI for your Snowplow Mini or other Snowplow collector in `DemoApp/App.js`.

**For Android:**

```bash
yarn example android
```
_Note_: Linux users who want to run the DemoApp for Android, would also need to run `yarn start` in a separate terminal.

**For iOS:**

```bash
yarn example ios
```

### End-to-end tests

Snowplow React-Native Tracker is being end-to-end tested using [Snowplow Micro][snowplow-micro] and [Detox][detox]. To run these tests locally:

#### Testing

1. Start your [Snowplow Micro][snowplow-micro] instance locally.
2. Replace the `placeholder` value for the `collectorEndpoint` variable in `example/src/App.js` (use the network IP address of your computer or ngrok).
3. Start the end-to-end tests:
   * On Android, run `yarn e2e:android`
   * On iOS, run `yarn e2e:ios`
